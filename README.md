# Pneumonia-detection-from-X-Ray-images-Kaggle-

In this colab notebook, I have built a CNN
to automatically identify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at X-ray images.

Accuracy on training set : 94.25 %

Accuracy on validation set : 89.7 %

Precision : 90.27 %

Recall : 95.13 %

F1 Score : 92.63 


*The dataset is obtained from kaggle*
